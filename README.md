Weather App
A sophisticated Flutter application for real-time weather updates, powered by the OpenWeatherMap API. Featuring dynamic Lottie animations, a responsive Material Design UI, and robust error handling, this app delivers a seamless experience across iOS and Android.

Getting Started
This project is a fully-featured Flutter weather application that displays real-time weather data, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and sunrise/sunset times, with animated weather visuals.
Prerequisites

Flutter SDK (^3.0.0)
Dart SDK (^3.0.0)
Android Studio or VS Code with Flutter plugins
OpenWeatherMap API Key
Git for cloning the repository

Installation

Clone the Repository:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/weather-app.git
cd weather-app


Install Dependencies:
flutter pub get


Configure API Key:

Sign up at OpenWeatherMap to obtain an API key.
Update lib/services/weather_services.dart:final String apiKey = 'YOUR_API_KEY_HERE';




Verify Assets:

Ensure Lottie animation files (rain.json, sunny.json, cloudy.json) are in the assets/ folder.
Confirm pubspec.yaml includes:assets:
  - assets/rain.json
  - assets/sunny.json
  - assets/cloudy.json




Run the App:
flutter run



Usage

Launch the app on a device or emulator.
Enter a city name (e.g., "Tokyo, JP") in the text field.
Tap Get Weather to view weather details and animations.
Explore metrics like temperature (in Celsius), humidity, wind speed, and formatted sunrise/sunset times.

Advanced Features

Dynamic Lottie Animations: Visualizes weather conditions (sunny, rainy, cloudy) using Lottie files.
Responsive UI: Adapts to various screen sizes and orientations.
Error Handling: Manages invalid city names and network issues with user-friendly messages.
Time Formatting: Converts UNIX timestamps to readable formats using the intl package:DateFormat('h:mm a').format(DateTime.fromMillisecondsSinceEpoch(timestamp * 1000));


Performance Optimized: Lightweight API calls and efficient state management.
Test Coverage: ~85% coverage with unit and widget tests (see test/ folder).
